                            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language
                                 for web page creation. It allows the creation and structure of sections,
                                  paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page)
                                   such as tags and attributes. </p>

                            <h3>CSS</h3>
                            <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets. Itâ€™s a stylesheet language that describes
                                 the appearance or presentation of a website. Essentially, CSS tells 
                                 web browsers how each element in an HTML document should be displayed.
                                Along with JavaScript and HTML, CSS is a crucial component to every web page 
                                on the Internet.
                                The main benefit of CSS is the ability to separate website content from the 
                                design elements, simply by changing rules in a CSS file. </p>

                                Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) 
                                in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java,
                                 its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling 
                                 and his team changed the name from Oak to Java. </p>
